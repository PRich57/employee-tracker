# Employee Tracker

## Description

  - The motivation for this project was to create an intuitive and interactive database of employee and company information.
  - With this application an employer can create, read, and update data relating to their employees, departments, and roles within the company.
  - Through the creation of this project, I learned how to relate data between tables in a SQL database, how to combine SQL databases into a user friendly command-line application, how to use JavaScript in conjunction with SQL, and how to create, read, and update data with SQL.
  - In the future, I plan to add additional tables and data, as well as menu items to allow users to remove data from the database. As I continue to develop as a software developer, I will also continue to update this with new technology I learn along the way.
